Next topic, social issues, social issues are also politics because there's a lot of things that need policies and when something need policies like laws, it is automatically considered as politics. 
<br>
This one is not super, super complicated. I would say. I think you understand that a lot of these but I am just going to give the extreme side of everything and tell you. What do I think about it? There are a lot of social issues, and there's also two sides to this. People also call the two sides left versus right, but this is for me to confusing because left vs. Right Is supposed to be for economics. So let's call them conservative versus progressive. Before we talk about what conservatives and progressives are. Let's first talk about what social issues there are. Can you guess what social issues they are? 
<br>
There's climate change like global warming. There's also lgbtq plus, there's also a human rights. There's also abortion. There's immigration. There's drugs. Let's begin with progressives. Progressives are basically the younger people in our generation. They believe in modern thinking, their opinions are very modern. 
<br><br>
For example, on gay. They're very supportive of gay people. They are also supportive of trans people. They're supportive of the queer people, right? They're supportive of all the modern new issues. Conservatives on the other hand, they don't really believe all these things. They believe more in their old ways. They might dislike gays. They might dislike trans. They might want things to be their way. The old way, conservative also means tradition. They basically want to stick with the tradition.
<br><br>
 Over the years, the spectrum of conservative and progressive changes. Because a hundred years ago, you would be considered as very, very progressive, If you like gay people to be allowed, but nowadays, it's just normal for gay people to be allowed, 50 years ago. If you want to trans people to be completely legalized, you would be very progressive, but nowadays, that's just kind of normal. right now in the Philippines. 
<br>
If you want abortions to be legalized you would be considered as super, super progressive because abortion is not fully legalized here yet. But in America, if you are for abortion, you are just kind of normal, right? So the spectrum is very different through out the world and throughoutt he timeline, from from what I noticed, progressives are the ones that are always winning right now. They're always pushing this spectrum further and further and further. 
<br>
And there are some problems when you keep pushing to one side. As you can see our world right now was the whole lgbtq + Community is getting bigger and bigger over the time. What does that mean? Well, we're going to go back to the very beginning of the beginning of the internet, the internet made something possible in the world. And that is a Social Circle. That is virtual, the internet. casically, made our world to a place that is very different, it made another world, that is separated from our real-world. 

<br><br>People who have the same opinions, can go to that internet and share their opinions. It is like they're a big big family. When you are on the internet with your community. It seems like everybody agrees with you. This creates the illusion that everybody in the world thinks in this way, but in reality, It doesn't really work like that. People tend to spend more and more time on the internet because not much people disagree with them. If they don't like to hear those disagreement, they can simply block them. They can simply, just don't look at it. 
<br>
In real life. If somebody disagrees with you. You can't just slap him in the face. You have to actually talk to them or walk away, but the person is still there in your life and the internet, if somebody disagree with you, you can block them and you'll never see them ever again. Sounds pretty cool, right, but that's a very big problem because people are getting more and more sensitive to smaller things in real life. 
<br><br>
They are so accustomed to the fact that everything online agrees with them that they can't really take the penny on the other side. This is a phenomenon called the echo chamber, echo chamber. What is an echo chamber? They think about it. Echo chamber is basically when you say “a” to a wall, and the wall “A’s back. Chamber is basically a whole big room of everybody. Just talkin about the same things. In real life, it is very hard to find a bunch of people that agrees with you on the exact same topic, right? But on the Internet is so easy to do that. So, you would think that you would be the majority in real life, but in real life, you are not really the majority of it is very interesting illusion that people has is, it's like a little safety bubble that you're in. And that's why I think people nowadays are so easily hurt, is because they're too used to hearing opinions of their own and they can't really engage in talking to other people and taking the fire from other people. 
<br>
Also one thing is that when you were in such a small community or such a big community, your experiences are very limited. You can't really experience as much things like talking to people from different perspectives and different views. You're going to be very stuck in your little own bubble ,stuck in your little own box that you don't really know what the real world is like, you know the world in your little perspective, but you can't see. It's your big lens through the real world not even through the internet world because you're just a small part of the internet. This whole thing makes me very concerned for our humanity, very concerned for our future because I think technology has changed our life to a point where we can't live without it. We have a life online. We can't leave the live online. 
<br>
It's like if we leave the internet, we killed ourselves. We killed the part of our self, social media makes people depressed because social media shows you the best part of other people's lives. Everybody likes to post the best part about their life. And when you as one person is comparing yourself to other people in the best part of their life, you will think that your life sucks. Look at everybody. 
<br>
Thousands of years ago. One person used to be only able to compare himself to five people in his neighborhood. There's only like five people that he know to compare with, but now thanks to technology. We can compare to the whole world compared to the whole world and compared to everybody's life. Everybody's best part of their life. We're comparing to everything and this destroys our confidence. This destroys our self-esteem that destroys us as a person. Human are evolving too slowly. We usually evolve over thousands of years and there's a lot of tracing us that are not fit for this world.
<br><br>
 Like human needs to reserve their genes, right? That's why they have to be horny to at least get a mate and have babies, but nowadays, human are using this horniness to watch porn. They're wasting this and did the human biology think that there's going to be porn? Of course not. What the heck? They did not think about that. There's going to be poor. How would they know that there's going to be porn right? Human body is designed to eat a lot of food at one point. So that just in case we don't have any food, at least we'll have some food in your stomach. This caused people to binge-eat binge-eating is basically eating like five bowls of rice, 10 bowls of cupcakes, wait 10 bowls of cupcakes, what am I talking about? with 10 cups of milk tea, you know what I mean? Well, this is biology. This is evolution, but it failed miserably because the biology did not predict technology and our software in our brain is not designed for this world. There are so many things wrong with social media, and so many things wrong with the technology that us humans. I think we're going in a very bad direction.
<br>
 If just this keeps going, People are too distracted with the current problems of the world. like me actually, me people like me likes negativity. I like to focus on the bad parts of the world and what happens when everybody focus on the bad part of the world, nobody's happy everybody just sad. They're concerned about the future. No one's living in the present. Everybody just compares themselves to other people. Where is the society going with this mindset? I don't know. I don't know how we can fix it.<br> 

But I know there's a problem and I think us as humans should find solutions together in the social issue. Isn't so ironic that the social media connects everybody together. If you want to talk to your friend from another country, you can talk to them. But how come social media made us so far apart from each other? Why is it so hard to find a friend that actually cares about you? Find somebody that celebrate you on your birthday, without the Facebook notification about it. What happened to this world? Of course. I'm also kind of optimistic because I think that there's some parts of human that is good. And I think together we can find a solution to fix this. I also sometimes like to focus on the good parts of the world, but I have to try to force myself to see both sides. 
<br><br>
Talking about both sides. There's a thing called, false dichotomy. Remember the fallacy false dichotomy. This is a fallacy that basically you are either yes or no. It is basically saying you're all in or you're nothing. It is basically assuming that a problem has only two solutions. Be careful because they're usually more solutions to a problem and also more opinions to a problem. For example, do you support abortion? People would say your user? 
<br><br>
Yes. Support abortion or no, don't support abortion. But that's a false dichotomy. There are a lot more options. You could say. Well, it depends is the victim raped was the victim harassed or was the victim just irresponsible. We don't know. And that's why the answer should not be yes or no, but is that it should be, tt depends. If there is one thing that you could take away from today is there is subjectivity and objectivity, these two terms. I used them a lot. Objectivity is when something has a truth like one plus one equals to two, that is objectively true. Subjectivity. On the other hand is opinions. 
<br>
For example, I think that red is a beautiful color. That is subjective because that is just my opinion. I want to tell you that social issues are subjective. Moral is also subjective. There's no absolute right? 
<br>
Or absolute wrong on these issues. They're not mathematics. There's no correct or wrong. That's why what I say is also subjective. Don't take this as any absolute truth. I'm very looking forward to hear your prejudices and your opinions, on everything that I've just said and that we can have a thorough discussion because I think on these kind of issues, everybody has their own experiences and everybody's opinion has the same weight. That means no one opinion is somehow more valuable than the other. All right. See you on the next lesson.
