  Today, we're going to talk about fascism since I can't really pronounce this word properly. I'm going to avoid saying this word as much as I can. So fascism. Noisy, Germany, Japan in World War II, these are kind of fascism. So you may ask me, why am I talking about them? Well, fascism is basically the authoritarian, right? If communism was authoritarian, left fascism is authoritarian, right? I think you probably not super familiar with the term, but I'm going to break it all down for you and I will tell you why this is also ask dangerous as communism. Fascism is also when there's absolute government control when the government controls everything, like all the people, and when there's a lot of police officers and dig military, and when everybody must be very United, and if not, you'll die. This is fascism back in 1940s. There are no democracy in fascism because Bashas believe that democracy is two stupid. Because people are stupid. People cannot really choose for themselves because people are Issac ate it and people are too easily manipulated. That's why one person or one government to decide for everything, for the side, for the Kum & Go's of people. You are not allowed to criticize fascism because if you lived in faster than the country and you criticize fascism, you would disappear and go to jail, and I basically that's what's going to happen to you. Nausea is considered as a branch of fascism. Not use them. Is basically government control to the extreme. Everybody Must trust the government for whatever that government wants to do. The Nazi government led by Hitler. They're aiming for an absolute control and National Unity. That's how the party was very popular by the Germans. They cost the Germans at that time was kind of racist. Hitler blame Jewish people for all the problems in the society. Hitler believes that Jewish are evil and they deserve to die. That's why he made the Holocaust. The Holocaust essentially is sending all the Jewish people in Germany to concentration camps and this resulted in six million Jewish people dying from the concentration camps. The famous book Diary of a young girl or dairy of Anne. Frank was made by a young girl hiding from the Nazi regime around that time. It is cruel and it is crazy. People say nausea them is far right? Because nausea them, support businesses. They believe that business to be allowed to exist and there should be private businesses. Some people say that Nazism is supported by capitalism, which, I'm not really sure. But maybe however, Nazism believes that there should not be businesses that are useless to the country. All businesses to be influential and useful to the country. For example, if there are poor nowadays and not the exam that would be banned for sure. Because poor is not good for the nation. They're very extreme and they don't allow a lot of things. They also don't have foreign trade, which means there's no trading with other countries. They believe that treating with another country makes your own country, more dependent on others. Usually, the country that have and Cactuses fascism are very racist. For example, Hitler was very racist. He believed that the Aryan race, which is the German race is, the most Superior race of everyone. And that, he believes that those people that are iron race to make babies. They should keep making babies. So that in the future, the whole world will be Irene's very crazy. Right? And Mussolini Benito Mussolini is the Italian dictator who also followed fascism him and Hitler were pretty good friends and they all are pretty racist, Japan, that the time is called Imperial, Japan and Imperial. Japan was also very racist Japanese. People believe that Japan was the most Superior race, the whole Asia. And that's why they killed millions of other people. That time Japan was also very fascist because they were allies was Germany and Italy. The best friend around that time and they also had absolute control by the government. People were very brainwashed at that time in Japan, sacrificing your own life is the most, honorable way of dying, pretty crazy to think about. I mean, I don't know what happened to Japan culture at that time, but it seems like brainwashing was very strong. Also, in Nazi Germany. The brainwashing is so strong that the children would tell the government. If their parent is complaining about the government or something brainwashing, as strong, when it is done on children. That is why I'm very disgusted. When the government is trying to teach children about things, that they don't actually understand yet and trying to brainwash the children to something that is very, very scary and disgusting. There is also no single example, of fascism working properly because the dictators always wanted to kill all the people that are against them, when the flow, House is not allowed to be spoken to the dictator. That means the dictator won't know when there's a problem in the dictatorship and that's why all the fascist and fails and the usually also kill millions of people, some people in the media, nowadays, like to say that, Donald Trump is a fascist, which is absolutely stupid, because, if people are able to criticize Donald Trump without going to jail, that already proved that. Donald Trump is not a fascist because of Donald Trump was a fascist. Nobody will be able to criticize him because he's just going to kill everybody and may everybody go to jail like Hitler does. So I don't know where those arguments come from and it's quite funny to think about, that's pretty much is for fascism. There's not much good things to say about it and we should absolute a voice box. Them, like how we should also avoid communism and socialism. See you in the next part because the next part is where I'm going to summarize all of these and tell you why we should stay somewhere in the center.
