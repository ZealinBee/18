            Today we're going to talk about inflation and investment before movie onto capitalism,we have to actually address some points of capitalism. So that we won't be too overwhelmed when we start talking about capitalism. Inflation, and investment are both simple and complicated ideas at the same time because these two are very related with each other. So, I decided to cover both of them at the same time. Let's jump into inflation first. I always talked about inflation to you. And why is inflation so important for me personally? Well, because inflation reflects how expensive the stuff is or how valuable your money is. Inflation basically tells the purchasing power of your money. For example, I have 100 pesos, 100 pesos can buy one apple. Let's just say that if one hundred pesoes can buy one, apple. The purchasing power of 100 peso is called. One apple purchasing power, if there's inflation 100 pesos will no longer be able to purchase one apple. 120 pesos might be needed for Apple. Basically our money is getting less and less and less valuable. The more there is inflation, the more useless our money is and that's why I'm so concerned about it. You know, I want my money to be useful and I think everybody should be sort of concerned about inflation because people care about the money, right? But inflation, doesn't really trigger a mindset. People gets more annoyed. If they actually lose their money like they dropped 500 pesos on the ground and they can't find it anymore. Think very triggered by that but inflation is also like that except that is more like if you have like 100,000 pesos and inflation rate is up by like 5%, You recently lost like 5% of 100,000 pesos. You know, that's like 5,000 pesos. You just lost, five thousand pesos. It's more painful than just losing money, but people doesn't feel, That's why the government knows that, government doesn't really care when there's inflation because people are not very reactive to inflation. Why does inflation happened? Oh, inflation happens when the money is less valuable. And what causes the money to be less valuable when the government prints money, of course, the money is going to be less valuable, cuz there's more money now in the circulation, everybody's like, oh my God, that's more money. So I should raise my products price and then this causes a chain reaction, but it's hard to notice, because people are numb with numbers, when inflation goes very slowly, like 2% per month. People find a hard time to notice it. Like, if you see the price changes a little bit, every month, you won't be that alarmed, right? That's why government knows that and government take advantage of that. This is why we need investment investment is very important because investment to help you gain that money back. I know that before I didn't talk about investment property. So this time I am going to be going through Investments, Elizabeth more clearly and slowly to go of investment is to get more money than you originally invested. If I want to invest 1000 Pesos. I want to get my 1,000 pesos back and more money. The goal of the investment is to beat inflation. If inflation is 5% every year. I want to earn more than 5% in my investment so that I don't lose any money because if there's inflation every year for 5%, I don't invest my money. That means I'm losing 5% of my money every year. Okay, why am I talking about 5%? Because right now the US inflation is 5.4%. Okay, and that's pretty high, is good to have some sort of inflation because if the inflation says zero nobody's going to spend their money, right? Everybody will just save their money that I cannot. What's the point of spending money if the money is going to be the same next year, right? So if there's some inflation people who spend their money, the economy will move itself. People have jobs to do, you know, they'll be more work to do and I think overall having a small inflation is a good thing. Before we jump back to investment. I want to give you some tips on what to do during inflation drain place in. Since your money is being more and more useless. What you can do is spend your money before it's too late. Let's give our imaginary scenario that say that you Sakura, you have a lot of money, but you know that your money will be more and more useless in the future. So you just spend your money on things that you can actually use like a house. You bought the house for 2 million pesos. And now you're living in the house and just enjoy your house. Right? Let's say that you use this house for 5 years and 5 years later, the house became 10 million pesos. Basically, you did nothing. You just bought the house, be enjoyed in the house and then you sell it for 10 minute passes because inflation. So technically, you did not lose anything. You enjoyed your house and you got your money back before World War II started. There's a country called hungry. And that's country had like 100% inflation every single day. So if you could buy bread with $1, that they next day, bread was cost $100 inflation. Sometimes when it's fucked up. It just completely out of control and everybody's going to die. Like that's why Hitler got so angry and he started World War II because inflation was too crazy. He was printing too much money and the whole economy just got crashed by inflation is so sad to see because people's money. Became papers, they're useless because of how big the inflation was people were burning their fucking money for like fired, completely disaster. Let's come back to investment. There are also other reasons for investment other than beating the inflation. Sometimes you just want your money to gain, you more money and that's totally justifiable. Now, I'm going to talk about how you can earn money by investing. This investment is a very, very broad term. There are tons of things that you can invest on. Let me give you some examples. There is gold. There's company there's buns their Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies and there are other things like investing a small store or investing your friends business. Those are all considered as investing. The first thing that you can do is look at how much money you have currently and decide, how much money do you want to get from investment? The thing is investment is not always fun. You will lose money. Also investment, if you don't do it properly, and I think most people lost money investment at some point, because investment needs a lot of thinking ahead and a lot of planning and a lot of willpower, For beginners like us. It is very nice to just decide on a stock and buy it and hold it for a long time. The reason why I say we have to hold it for a long time, is because many people make the mistake of buying a stock and selling it immediately. Let's give you a very, very extreme example. 30 years ago, Amazon just started and that just say that somebody bought a stocking Amazon's up time and Amazon became very successful. And the person was like, oh my God, this talk is so valuable. No, I'm going to sell my stock and I'm going to earn 10% of the money. That's a lot. Right? So the person sold his stock immediately. Little, does he know that if he didn't sell the stock immediately right now, he could have burned like a hundred or two hundred or one thousand percent. He was not patient enough to understand. And Forest beginners. It is best to be patient because we don't understand and we don't know enough. So the best thing to do is stop pretending to be smart and just buy stock and hold it forever. Obviously. I don't mean forever. I'm just saying just saw it until you really need the money. The banks are such a big scam, bandsaw furyu interests. Technically. You can also invest your money and saving your money in the bank, but that's not really interesting because you're only getting 1% or 0.1% money back every year, and you're basically losing your money to inflation. So, if you want to gain money from investing, it is not a wise choice to save it in the bank. Honestly, I'd rather just spend the money on the fence that you like, because if you buy the things now, you didn't really lose the money. You just exchanged your money to a product. But if you hold your money in the bank, you lose some of the money, like the penny, or how much, the same place in is, that's why? If you have a lot of spare money, put them all in investment, but before we put them investment, let's look at how we can decide whether we can earn money or not from your vestment. So what makes investment earn money? Well, you see when company becomes more and more successful. Their stocks will be more and more valuable because more people wants to invest their money inside that business. So if you see a business that is going to be successful in the future, but isn't successful yet, right now, then it'll be a very wise choice to spend your money and invest the money in this business. I see a real life example. Let's say that measure is starting a business. And since we both know that measure is good at business. We are going to predict that his business will be successful in the future. Of course, when he started the business. He doesn't really have that much money to start the business. He can't really expand the business. So he decided to make his business public to everybody. So now you and I, we can both invest in his business. Investing in his business is basically us borrowing money. So that you could use to expand his business and in the future, if his business was successful. He'll return the money to us that he borrowed. And he'll give us some extra money since we helped him at first. But if mesha somehow filled his business, he won't be able to return the money that we gave him anymore, because his business has failed, which means we have to be smart about food. We give our money to or what company do we invest if you are able to predict, that apple is going to be successful, 40 years ago, then you'll be very very rich right now, but we know that in the future Apple Google and Facebook, these companies are probably still going to be more successful. So it's probably pretty smart for us to still invest in these companies because these companies will only get bigger and bigger. Does look at everybody, they're using their phone all the time. So they'll be very wise to continue team guessing these companies. Nowadays, everybody talks about Bitcoin cryptocurrencies and all of these digital stuff. In reality, Bitcoin does not worse anything physical. It is essentially their people believe in the money. That's why it exists or paper money does not worth anything. Everybody believes that the paper money or something, because everybody shares the same Miss shares, the same value and shares the same beliefs that money is worth this much. That's why Bitcoin is also worst $60,000. Right now, one Bitcoin, a few years ago only costed a few hundred dollars, but now one Bitcoin $60,000. Why are bitcoins so expensive now? And why is everybody buying Bitcoin? It is because people think that their paper currency is becoming more and more useless. Thanks to the bad government and they'd rather buy something that doesn't exist like Bitcoin. They'd rather put their money on bitcoin rather than holding it on to their cash. Seeing a trend like this. It really makes me want to invest, but not in Bitcoin because Bitcoin is too expensive, but invest my money into something rather than holding it and letting it diminish. I could even embarrassing. Myself investment is such an interesting concept because you can buy books to yourself or investing a skill, buy a new course online and learn something that is invest in yourself. And in the future, you can get the money back by working or by making a new business, investing in such a powerful idea that I think we could do it in our everyday lives, who can best on our friendship? We can invest our time on the skills that we like, we can also invest our time on YouTube and learn something or waste our time there. Who knows so investing, you can gain, something, you can lose something. I've covered all the basics of investing. I don't want to go too deep to technical terms because I'm not good at it. I only understood the fundamental concept. Pretty well, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I'll be glad to answer.
