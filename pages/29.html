            There are a lot of things that I have misunderstood about you and about women in general, and I think I am going to tell you what I have learned along the way. Thanks to you, this is not related to politics at all. I just wanted to talk about this and get this off my stomach. So, I have always treated you like a man.  I’m not saying that I see you as a man, it's just that I expect your emotions, to be like a man. And that is a huge mistake by me because sometimes there are things that you feel that I don't feel, because we're different people. And there are different perspectives. Sometimes, I tend to expect you subconsciously, to also feel the same way as I do about certain things. That's why sometimes you may not feel very heard enough , and I believe I should change the perspective, and understand more about you and, in general, the differences between male and female. I think it is a very very big topic. I have actually read a few books about this. And I realized evolutionarily we are quite different. I feel sorry about the things. There have been things that I've said or done because I don't think I understand you at that point of time I still don't think I do. But I believe I'm getting on the right path. There's certain things that I don't understand as well as the male, because not every male is the same right? Obviously, they are different. Females are different as well, but I have to acknowledge the fact that these two are pretty different from each other. I tend to dismiss and make fun of certain emotions and feelings, since I don't feel that way, and I feel like it's silly, but I realized that it is quite different. Now if you have different perspectives on certain things, and of course different experiences. I grew up, I grew up with a bunch of dudes. Until now. I don't have any close female friend until you and I would say that's why, it’s is also not very wise of me to try to understand female with logic, there's certain things that are just completely different that I have to think in a different form and different way. And there are things I won't be able to understand or have never and never will be able to understand because there's no experiences. There's no constant thinking, the brain might be just too different. I think I'm going to try my best to. And I think females also tend to treat now as females, and sometimes you need to expect me to understand the author contests, but it is quite difficult because people told me they simply don't feel that way. We don't think they are allowed now they can do that because they've been feminized when they're younger, they have an optimal interactions with female at such a young age that they tend to understand more and more attuned to the female side of themselves, which is great. There are obviously downsides and upsides for both of this, but I think there is no much disadvantages to still learn about all of these things. I hope you had a really nice birthday or for me, I think, 18 year old is pretty crazy to think about. I still can't really see myself as an adult, because I only have one. I really hope I could be more mature in my mind because recently I see myself, all the thoughts that I have employee mature I am beginning to understand how there's a lot of growth stages that I still have to do. It is good that I sort of realized them so I have a direction to follow. And I hope we found the same cause, improve ourselves physically, psychologically, mentally, knowledge, and experiences. He came is definitely not that old yet, we're scaling our golden age, I think our golden age will last for about 10 more years. So I think we should really cherish our time, and use these times as things that we're going to regret in the future. I think we should make friends with ourselves in the future and be nice to them because we're basically the same person as ourselves in the future so why not treat them nicely. I hope you can read the book that I gave you. I think is a pretty nice book to knock you and for other people. It is sort of narcissistic, in some ways or egocentric. I think it is better to be too attached to what other people's perception of you is because I feel like that takes away all our power from you. If you're listening to this before listening to others. Okay I added other things about more frequently, there is more mistakes in this one because editing, only sound more genuine. The other ones there is no mistakes, pretty much because I cut them out and I read speak them, you know, so I hope you're not listening to this one before everything in Reese, I really hope that you also enjoy this audio course, and congratulations for finishing it. I hope by then you have your own opinion about everything that I've said, and we can have a proper conversation about all these things and you have a head start now to learn about so much things and you can also start your own journey and see.
