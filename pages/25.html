          I know you've been waiting for this and finally, it is capitalism. Capitalism. This is going to be a pretty long session. I'm going to talk about a lot of things regarding to capitalism and talk about some facts, some history. And of course some opinion. 
          <br>When you want to buy milk, you go to a shop, right? And you give some money to the cashier and you get the milk. Why is this simple idea of transaction work so well, and how did we come to this? <br>And what are the flaws? Before  answering all of that, we have to go back to a few thousand years ago. Back in the day, when humans started agriculture. We lived in one place because we have to wait for our crops to harvest, right? So we cant move any more like before(hunter gatherer days). What happens is that Villages were built and societies were built because we all have to stay on the same place. What happens? <br>Some people are farmers. Some people are Hunters. Some people are Baker's some people are Fishers. Some people are this and some people are that, if fisher wants to buy some bread. The Fisher has to give like one fish for one bread or two fish for two bread or something like that. <br>If a farmer wants to sell his wheats to a bread Baker, then the farmer has to give some wheats in exchange for some bread. That's a very functional and simple Society. Right? But this type of society are usually very tiny and it is simple for them to just change their stuff. If they want other stuff, when the society becomes big and complicated. It has to be one currency for everybody, one Currency for everybody to Believe in a currency that everybody could use to buy values. <br><br>
          This is where capitalism kind of started, but this is quite different from the modern idea of capitalism. So around that time, there will be small coins, the government, or the kingdom would have small coins. These small coins represents currency, is very hard to fake them. People would go to the palace and change their bread or fish to these coins and with coins they can buy stuff all around because everybody has changed their stop to those coins. <br><br>In the modern day society, we exchange our work efforts, we exchange our production of services to these coins, but nowadays they are money they are paper. So how does this system work? <br>Remember what I said before about language, since human have language, we can communicate with each other in a very sophisticated way. <br>This makes our brain structure also very sophisticated and all of us could believe on certain things, and agree to the rules, babies are pretty bad agreeing to rules. They tend to break the rules. But as babies grow up they know how to follow rules. <br>And when most people in a society, agrees to follow to a certain rule, like the money, then something like capitalism would work pretty well. <br>Normally, let's say that you’re a person, you want to get this service. You want to get a massage. So you have to pay money for that massage, right? That means if you want to get the massage, you have to first get the money. What do you need to do to get the money, well you have to provide services to other people, do things that you're good at. You have to do things that you're good at to be a body to other people to get money back from them. <br><br>This is why capitalism forces people to do things that they don't want to do an exchange for the things that they want to have. It is using the greed of people of wanting more things to force people to provide more things to the society. <br><br>Obviously, there are a lot of disadvantages for capitalism. But before moving to the downsides, let's finish the advantages of capitalism. <br>Remember Adam Smit?  The economics guy from a long time we learned about. He talked about the idea of the Invisible Hand.<br> What is the Invisible Hand? Sounds quite stupid. Well the Invisible Hand is actually the competition and capitalistic worl,  There is competition. If two people both have the same idea, they both want to sell fishes, the fishes sellers who has the best fish, and the cheapest price will win the competition and therefore make the most money.<br> But in order for them to win the competition, they have to actually make fishes that are better than the other competitors. This means they have to have cheaper prices, right? Another example we have is iPhone, before iPhone existed. There was nokia. There was all those basic phones, that are pretty lame. But Steve Jobs came up with the iPhone, the touchscreen. And he made Innovation because he knew that people would enjoy these things more. He knew how to serve the people and he knew how to make people happy to pay. <br>This could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing. But ultimately this drives progress. This makes our lives better in some ways and this drives the people who are lazy out. It rewards good behaviors like working hard because the harder you work in a smart way of course the harder you work. The more likely you are to receive the reward and enjoy your life better and this punishes bad behaviors, like being lazy and useless to the society. <br>Average people today, thanks for capitalism could buy more things than Kings from hundreds of years ago because of the easy transportations of foods and services and people could have so much choices, even though you're like a normal person, you could buy like, milk tea. That is made by so much ingredients and Kings back in the day, probably wouldn't have all the luxuries that we have today. They would be shocked at what we have today. Capitalism also rewards behavior like taking risks, taking risk, doing, making a new business, making new ideas. Because if you take risk, there's a certain possibility that your business will become big and you'll be able to earn more money than other people. One cool thing about capitalism is that most people could succeed in the system, if you play fair, and if you are a good citizen, if you're a good person, you could succeed in this system. It doesn't mean that you'll become top 1%, but it does mean that you can live in the system, pretty comfortably living better than the average person as long as you know how the system work. And you know, how to use your ability to fit the system. <br><br>There won't be useless products in the society, most of the time because of demand and Supply, we talked about in the first module. <br>Demand and Supply with simply makes the useless products useless because since there's no demand, there's no way anybody could sell those products and make profit, leaving the world was mostly useful and productive stuff. So far. So good, right? Everything sounds great. Wow, that's moved to the disadvantages.<br><br> Not every disadvantage or problem in the world is caused by capitalism. Most of the problems are caused by humans in this capitalism world, but capitalism makes some things worse.<br> Super individualism. I'm sure you understand
          his concept is when everybody is so individualized that they find it hard to help other people, even if they are their friends or their families, helping other people is like making a business transaction, you expect other people to help you back or something or you're making relationship with other people only because the other people could somehow benefit you in some way, the sense of community is gone in a lot of areas because people are just too individualistic they are too egoistic, everybody's playing their own game. The game of capitalism separates people and is hard to form a team, in this system. There's a thing called crony capitalism. Crony Capitalism is basically what we have right now. There are few big companies that are basically controlling Our Lives to the point where they have more power than the governments. Think about it, Apple Google Facebook. These companies have too much influence over us. And this is what happens with capitalism. What causes crony capitalism? That's a great question cronyism or crony capitalism happens. When big businesses and the government are basically one team, they're helping each other and they're basically just on the same team. <br>Businesses doesn't become big because they offered good Services. They become big simply because the government is killing all those small services in order to help the bigger services.<br> I can give you a super good example. In the time of covid-19. A lot of small restaurants are forced to be closed by the governments. All of these restaurants need some sort of lockdown because there's transmission of covid-19. McDonald's are not closed, those businesses are still open and people could still go to McDonald's. Somehow. This is talking about the United States. <br>When I realize that this is happening. I realized the capitalism that we living is no longer true capitalism because when the government, and the businesses are on the same team. There's always corruption. <br>Another example could be Amazon, Amazon became so big and covid because of all small stores being closed up. And when all the small stores are being forced to close up because of covid-19, Amazon becomes very handy for everybody because you can just buy stuff online. I know everybody has the habit of using Amazon and all the small businesses are dead. So is it crony Capitalism very, very dangerous, but it is what we live in. <br><br>Also I was talking about progress is progress, really a good thing? I talked about this a while ago about the social media ruining our society. And I think this is because we can adapt to these things fast enough before it kills us. There are just too much things that we are not used to, in 5 years or in 10 years. There's going to be very, very smart, artificial intelligence. That is going to replace almost all the jobs available and when people don't have job, they don't really have much to do, do they? They don't have a purpose in life. They don't have meaning in life and we're going to become super lazy our mind will become very blank. <br>This is thanks to technology. Making us lazy right? Technology can do so much things for us. We stopped thinking. We're basically have computer already because we can't even leave our cell phone on the table for more than 10 minutes. I don't know if that's a good thing. It might seem pretty cool. But our great life is not really appreciated by the younger Generations because there's a concept or human happiness does not change for the long-term when something like this or human happiness change when there's something good happen to us, but the younger Generations are used to this nice lifestyle. <br>They never really experienced what the sadness is the never experienced how fortunate they are. Therefore. They're not actually happier than the people from 50 years ago who didn't have cell phones. They're the same. is it worth it? That the cell phones are making the kids very dependent yet. It didn't really make them happier than people 50 years ago with all the cell phone is very interesting.<br> People get used to being happy too easily. For example, if you one day, you go to a big house and live in the big house at first you'll feel very happy about the big house. But after a year, you'll be used to the big house to the point that your happiness is the same was before you went to the big house.<br> You might find it hard to believe that but it is proven this way and it is more apparent for the people who are born that big house. <br>The person who was born in a big house, with feel the same happiness with you. It sounds quite absurd, but it is what it is. So does making constant progress, really good. If it doesn't make us happy in the long term, it is worth all the damage to the environment, all the sacrifices to the Earth, all the sacrifices with nature and all of the irreversible damage, we did to our planets.<br><br>Is really difficult to know that our worst can really be changed back to what it is before unless we tear down some of the things that we have. If you tell a person was Big House, move to a small horse, they find it, very difficult to be used to it.<br><br> There are other issues as well. Remember all the things that we talked about all like the advantages, like anybody could succeed. <br>Well, not anybody could succeed because there's some people that are born in the environment that is very unfair to them. For example, they have like drug addict parents, or they have had a horrible education, or bad influence. These people can’t really escape shithole. It is unfair for them. So technically, you know, not anybody could succeed in the system and the poor people will stay poor for very long time because generational habits does not really change. <br>Also, it does reward hard work, but it's also exploits hard work. I think you might not be too familiar with the term exploit, but exploit is basically businesses exploiting their worker, but not giving them enough compensation for the work that they have.<br> Countries like Japan and Germany are filled with people who are very hardworking, but businesses there are very, very smart at exploiting these hard work and making people work very hard and making them miserable. While. Yes, they do have a lot of money. They're miserable.<br> They're not really happy and all the people got rich not because they play the game fair, no, is because they play the game unfairly and exploited other people and cheated in the system in order to get money. They do not provide any value to the society, but they were still able to gain money because they knew how to exploit the system because capitalism is very easily exploitable, for example, a business could simply move their company to China and make the people in China work for the company while giving them, very small, minimum wages. Since, for example, of company would have to pay $10 every hour for American. The only have to pay $1 per hour for Chinese. That's why so many manufacturing companies are in China to exploit all these people who don't really know how much value they are worth. The inequality of the world is too high, the top 30, richest person in the world has the same amount of money with the bottom 50% of the entire world, 30 richest, people's money is equivalent to 3 billion people. That sounds too crazy, but capitalism allows that to happen. Now, I know now. Capitalism. Sounds like a horrible shit, but in the next topic, we're going to talk about communism. The solution for capitalism stay tuned and I'll see you later.
