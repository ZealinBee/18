Okay, let's move to the other side of the political Spectrum, ISM and socialism. I'm pretty sure that you are not very familiar with both of these terms. So today, I'm going to explain to you further than what I have said before. These two ideologies are both considered to be far-left and authoritarian. So if we recall, far-left authoritarian is basically up in the political spectrum and left in the political Spectrum. So up left. Okay, we're going to first start with socialism because I think socialism is slightly more easier to explain socialism is when everybody owns the means of production and the means of production is distributed by the government. Basically, the government will collect everything that we made and the government will distributed fairly. There are a lot of countries like Denmark Sweden. Germany does has socialistic policies. Socialistic policies does not necessarily mean, socialism socialistic policy, simply means that the government has control over certain things. People in Scandinavian countries, have free healthcare, and they also has a lot of pension when they are old. This is when the government collects your assets and take your taxes and make them to something useful, like free healthcare and free education. If this is done correctly, the socialistic policies can help all of countries like those Scandinavian countries. For example, Finland, education in Finland is completely free. And it is great because everybody could start and educate themselves and they have the best quality education. Thanks to socialistic policies. This is actually very nice for the poor people. Remembering the last episode. I talked about how poor people are stuck in the bottom of the society. Well, if socialism is done correctly, those poor people will have help from the garments. They will at least have a house or something, or they will have some sort of free education so that they can come back to the society and maybe be useful again. The socialistic ideology is a great idea. If it's done correctly, if the government is not corrupt and if the people are nice, then socialistic ideas is very good for Humanity. I do not dislike the idea of socialism, but I dislike the people who really love this idea. There's some people that really love this idea of socialism and these people are usually very lazy people who failed in the capitalistic Society. These people blame everything on the system. They think that all of their failures is because capitalism sucks. That's why they think. Socialism should be the replacement for capitalism. There's a guy America and his name is Bernie Sanders. He believes that America should be like socialism like Denmark and Sweden, but let me tell you why America can't go through socialism. First of all, Denmark and Sweden are not socialist. They just have socialistic policies. Second of all those Scandinavian countries are very tiny and everybody's white. There's no cultural differences and there's no inner debate. However, America is a very big country was over 300 million people. There white people, yellow people, black people from people. These people are constantly fighting over each other over ideas and cultural differences. Socialism, was simply not work because those people live in America, does not want to pay high taxes to support the people from another race. There's no unity in the country. And that's why socialism is very hard to achieve the America. Bernie Sanders wants the college to be completely free America. He also believes in free healthcare for everybody. But I think these ideas are very difficult to achieve in such a big country, like America. They're just too much complications. That will happen when things are free. And I think one country that big is making everything free. It'll make the people more and more lazier, and make less, and less marker decisions. And also says they're high taxes in the country. Thanks, the socialism, all the rich, people will simply start running away from America. A great example is California, California is pretty much like socialism already. They have very high taxes for the rich people and they gave it all the free stuff to the poor people. But they're still so many homeless people in California and the environment is completely destroyed on the streets and their trash is everywhere. Even though the weather is beautiful and the landscape is great. Rich people are running away to other states in America just because of how high the taxes are a great history example of socialism, is that pure socialism never worked for Pete. Pure socialism never worked, even once every single pure socialism country has became state capitalism. State capitalism is basically, when the government owns everything and the government doesn't really distribute things properly like, Cuba Venezuela and countries like those. The goal of socialism is to achieve the equality and opportunity which means everybody has the same starting point. Everybody begins on the same line. There's a problem with stairs and that is when you are a parent of a children. Obviously, you want your children to have a head-start over other children. That's why you owe everything to put your children in advantage over other children and most parents wants to do this. This causes a competition that breaks the Socialist cycle and somebody will eventually break the cycle and socialism will no longer be socialism and that's why socialism fails all the time. Let's move on to Communism. If socialism is, equality of opportunity,, ism is equity. Equality of opportunity. AKA socialism wants everybody to start on the same starting line. However,. None of them wants everybody to end in the same place. So no matter what you do, you end with everybody else. Let's just say that we have 10 people in a race socialism makes everybody starts on the same line, nizam, make sure that everybody ends on the same line. Basically everybody gets a participation award. I honestly can't give a unified definition on communism because those fucking Communists are fighting themselves in the YouTube comments and fighting themselves online. So I don't really know what the definition of communism is agreed on by those communist people. These people should really figure out what the hell, is. It really mean to them? People who talk about communism seems like they're very smart about communism and they read so much books and the understand so much things. But in reality, they don't really understand human nature at all. And they are just fighting over each other like children. I'm just looking at their perfect grammar, but City told they'll pretend that they understand what time does the MS without actually experiencing any of it. All right. Now, I'm going to tell you my understanding from all these people on. What kind is it really is? Communism. Is basically the solution against all the problems in capitalism. Remember, all the problems in capitalism. We have any quality in people and some people are super age. Some people are super poor and there is like two fast progress and stuff. Like that,, His name is a solution to fix all that. It wants to achieve a society where There's no classes. There's no Rich. Poor. Everybody are just one class. This is the direct opposite and the direct solution to capitalism. And this is originated in Germany by a guy called Karl Marx. So far, there's also no successful,. This nation's China is not communist. China is a state capitalist. It is simply a thorup Orion and little bit right-leaning does not have any left policies that I can think of. So technically China calls himself a colonist. They're not really a communist. China was a commonest. A few decades ago. Let me just tell you a few million people died because of a normal food. Oh, yeah, Democratic People's Republic of Korea is actually North Korea and there's Democratic. That's the way we should. Definitely not. Look at the country's name and decide whether it is that or not, because North Korea is definitely not. Democratic, North Korea is example of Communism. North Korea is perfectly commonest and a perfect failure on 40. It did not work well and it became a dictatorship. I went back to China in 2019 and I noticed some good parts of China. China has a very fast internet. China also has a very nice mobile companies. China has a very fast payment system and all of these. Good parts of China is actually capitalistic and all the ship part of China is. It's super authoritarian and there soon as their ship everywhere. There are surveillance everywhere, and I don't feel safe in the country. Communism is basically a bit fat middle finger to the capitalism. But in order for communism to happen, there should be a revolution. The people should band together and fight the capitalistic classes in history. The USSR was made in this way. There's a guy and his name was linen, linen. He organized the people at that. Time in Russia and started a Communist Revolution. He took over Russia and many other countries near Russia and formed the USSR aka the Soviet Union. Lenin died shortly afterwards because he was pretty sick and Stalin took over. Starling didn't really follow his vision. Sterling just became a dictator and became a tyrant and millions of people starved under him. And I wonder why this coming isn't always become like that. There was like a good leader starting it. There was a good leader, begin the Revolution and then another person takes over and then become a dictatorship. It always become like that. Lemon, he's old Vision was to take over the entire world and make the entire world communism. Because, nizam cannot coexist with capitalism. It must abolish capitalism back in the day in China. There's a guy named to multi home. And this this mother fucker. He basically organized all the poor people and beat all the rich people and took their houses and killed all the rich people. This resulted in millions of people dying because those rich people turned out, they were actually, the ones were productive in the society, and made all the food and all the crops after mall. Killing all those rich people. There are no more food, but he became a dictator as well, and millions of people died. Under him, Zoom, would actually really work. Well, if people are good people, if everybody are just nice and the people in the garments are nice, they would actually redistribute the things. Play well, in the system would work perfectly. But unfortunately, humans are way too imperfect to Raw a such a perfect system properly. There's always some problems to the curse that flips, the whole system over in the future with artificial intelligence. Take over our jobs. Maybe that's the time we're coming as in more rice because people simply has no more value to provide and no more money to earn in a capitalistic world. So maybe that time comes and we'll work. But for now, this is definitely not how we solve the problems in the modern world. There was a famous saying, USSR back in the day. This saying was made by the workers at that time in the same was they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.
