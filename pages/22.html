          Welcome back. And finally, we're done with all that economic nonsense.
          Today. We're going to talk about politics up versus down in political
          and personal freedom. What is personal freedom? What do you think?
          What is personal freedom? Okay, I'm going to go through this very
          slowly because this topic is a very, very packed topic. It is very
          current, very contemporary and very, very important. This is all about
          big government vs. Small government, authoritarian, vs. Libertarian.
          Big government is basically authoritarian. Small Government is
          basically libertarian. Remember the quiz. Again, we both got
          libertarian, which means we both want the government to not be too
          big. What the hell is big? And what is small? How do we define that
          first? Let ‘s do some thought experiments. So, big government? What is
          the first image that pops up to your head when you think about the
          word, big governments? Is it a white house? That is very big. Is it
          the military? That is very big? Big tanks. Big machine guns. What do
          you think about it? Big government is basically there is a lot of
          control by the government to the people when the government has a lot
          of power to do what it wants to do, for the sake of people. For
          example, the government has a lot of police officers. Police officers
          are used to fight crime and are also used for fighting the people that
          are not compliant to the government. The government also has a big
          military. A big military. Many soldiers. North Korea is a very tiny
          tiny country, right? But almost everybody is a soldier. That’s because
          They have big, big governments. The government also includes
          surveillance surveillance. What is surveillance? Surveillance is a
          pretty big word. when there is CCTV everywhere, the CCTV on your
          computer, the CCTV on the wall CTV on the streets. The government sees
          exactly what you're doing. That's called surveillance. There's also
          censorship. Censorship is basically when the government destroys the
          information that they don't, like, of course, in a world where the
          government is big. There are a lot of people that doesn’t like the
          government. For example, you don't like big government. So you go
          online and say, I don't like this big argument because of XYZ m
          because the government is big, they could just put you into the prison
          and delete your message on Facebook. That's big governments. Let's
          compare authoritarianism versus libertarianism. Again, authoritarian
          is big government. A Libertarian is a small government. Let's have two
          people. Person A, his name is Bob. Bob is a Libertarian, Person B. His
          name is dick, dick is authoritarian. So, let's see how Bob and Dick
          are in those situations. number one. They both don't like a YouTube
          videos. Bob, since he's a Libertarian. He just go to the video and
          comment. I don't like your video but dick, dick is authoritarian. So
          he reports the video to the YouTube and say stuff like : this video
          should be banned because I don't like the video. Number two situation.
          Both of them are vegetarians. Bob is a vegetarian and dick is also,
          Bob doesn't care. That other people are not vegetarians. He is
          vegetarian, because he chose to be. People don't want to be
          vegetarian. It's fine. It's up to them. Anyways, dick on the other
          hand. He thinks that everybody should be vegetarian. If he is a
          vegetarian, the government must make laws to ban all the meat, very
          crazy, right? But it is what it is. Another one, Bob and Dick both
          don't believe in God. They think that God does not exist. Bob respects
          everybody. Who believes in God and does not force his own belief on
          other people, Dick on the other hand, since he's authoritarian. He
          thinks that God is stupid. And everybody who believes in God should go
          to jail and be banned. There should be no Bible. Everything should be
          according to what he wants the government to have the power to do.
          Last example, gays, Bob and Dick are both not gay. They are both
          straight, bob doesn't care about gay people. He thinks that gay people
          are just gay, it is fine. They want to be gay but he's not gay so he
          doesn't care. Dick, On the other hand thinks that gay is horrible. He
          think that gay should not be allowed. He thinks that gay should be
          banned from the society and then from the world, Of course, the
          examples could be flipped. For example, if Bob and Dick are both gay,
          then Bob wouldn't Force other people to be gay. But dick will force
          everybody to be gay because he thinks the gays is the only correct
          sexual orientation, or something. This might actually sound like a
          great idea as long as your opinion aligns with this. I'll give you a
          quick example. A real life example, masks are good. Right? Masks are
          good. According to science. There is some sort of effective rate like
          5% or 10% effective. So everybody should wear masks since a mask is
          good. But this could be dangerous because what if the data is lying,
          like vaccines, for example, vaccines are good right there so everybody
          must take it. If you don't take it. You have to go to jail, or have no
          more work. This is very dangerous, very quickly. Like, At first, this
          could sound very, very harmless. For example, Vitamin D is very good
          for your body. Therefore everybody must take vitamin D. I mean, it
          sounds pretty good. Right? Or For example, education is good therefore
          every child must take Education First. When we are too used to the
          idea that there's something good. Everybody should do it. This could
          lead to some interesting events because what is good, and what is bad?
          Who is there to decide that? If the people in the government are there
          to decide what is good or bad. They could do whatever they wanted to
          do. Like lockdown, for example, lockdown is good for the People's
          Health. Lockdown is to protect your grandmother. Therefore everybody
          Must be locked up. If you don't lock down, stay at your house, you are
          going to get fined. That's what is happening. Also in China, you must
          follow the government because it is good for you and people are easily
          fooled by this. Like when a normal person when they listen to the
          government, they're like, oh my God, the government is so caring for
          me. Like it's so nice that everybody has to wear masks. So we can
          protect each other and everybody must lock down so that we can stay
          home and everybody could be safe. You see all the problems already?
          One day, The government could simply knock on your door and say, hey
          there, give me all of your information because the government we are
          looking for criminals. This is for your own good. If you're not a
          criminal, you should not be worried. And just give us all your
          documents.
          <br />
          Okay, let's go to libertarian, libertarian. Where did the idea
          libertarian come from? Well, there's one reason why Western
          Civilization is somehow better than the East because Western
          Civilization believes in individuality. They also believe in Freedom.
          They also believe in choices by themselves, democracy, people choose.
          Jesus Christ also made a lot of these ideas. He believed that humans
          are equal. There should be human rights given to people who see, all
          of these ideas sound very basic and simple but they are actually
          extremely important for our civilization. Individual choices are so
          powerful when people are educated and smart enough. Society can run
          itself without big government in libertarian beliefs, that in a
          situation like covid-19, people should research themselves and make
          their own decisions. If they're scared of the virus. They can stay
          home. If they're not scared of the virus. They can go out and work.
          Nobody is threatening each other. Because if you're scared, you can
          simply stay home by yourself. You don't have to force other people to
          stay home with you. Also on vaccinations. If you're scared of the
          virus, you could take the vaccine like, go ahead, nobody cares, but
          you should not force me to take the vaccine. I should be the one to
          decide whether I want the vaccine or not, because I'm not harming you
          by not taking the vaccine. It is proven that vaccines does not help
          you from spreading the virus. So, why the hell should I be forced to
          take the goddamn vaccine? Right? Of course, libertarian believe that
          government should have some role in society. The government should be
          in charge of the military and defense and security of people. There
          should be criminal justice systems, of course, so that the bad people
          couldn't get away, but they don't want to risk their freedom for
          security. They don't want to give the government that information just
          for the government to protect them. There are basically two sides to
          authoritarianism and two sides to libertarianism. So remember we are
          talking about economics earlier. So now this is all coming together.
          If you're on the authoritarian left, you are communism. We're going to
          talk about coming to them later. If you're authoritarian right. You
          are fascism basically like Hitler, you know, we're going to also talk
          about fascism later. If you're in the libertarian left, you are
          anarchist, and anarchists are those teenagers who are super angry and
          think that there should be no government. They think that there should
          be no money. All money should be abolished. Everybody should just live
          happily together. That's anarchists. Lastly. We have
          libertarian-right. They think that money should be able to buy
          everything in the world. They think that the government should not be
          part of the economy?They think that the government should not be part
          of their lives? Money should be everything. All of these for size.
          When you are extreme it is very bad. That's why we should stay in the
          center. All right, and in the next few audio courses, I'm going to
          talk exactly what's fascism i. Communism is what other things are.
          We're also going to talk about Donald Trump. We're going to talk about
          1984. We're also going to talk about Social issues and so stay true
          and see you next time.
