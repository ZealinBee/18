           Hello there, letâ€™s start off this whole course, very strong, and immediately talk about what economics is. <br>Today we're specifically going to talk about economic freedom. Let that word sink to your mind a little bit. Economic freedom. What is that?<br><br> Remember the quiz that we took a few weeks ago, it was about a political compass, and the compass decided that where we ,on the left or on the right.<br> Honestly, is kind of confusing because right and left doesn't really mean anything. That's why today I'm going to explain to you what exactly that means. And this is very useful for you to start the political journey of understanding. <br>So before we start anything, we have to actually understand what economics is. Economics is basically built around the idea of supply versus demand. <br>Now, I'm sure these two terms are extremely familiar to you. But let me just elaborate them a little bit further, supply is basically how much supply of something there are, how much of something is available out there that is supply, <br> demand on the other hand, is how much people want something, how much an item is demanded by people. <br> All right, here's an example. Apple devices iPhone MacBook. These are pretty expensive. And that is because demand is pretty high.  So Apple can take advantage of that and just make the price high, because people will buy it anyways. <br>On the other hand we have products like bananas. Why are bananas so cheap? Why aren't bananas $10 per banana? That is because the supply for bananas is very high. <br>There are just too many bananas out there. And if you sell bananas for $10. Nobody will buy it. <br>Okay yeah I know I know these examples are very stupid and simplistic, but these are the root ideas of an economy. Somebody wants to buy something and somebody wants to sell something, they agree on the price, and boom, transaction. <br>Okay, let's get back to the original question, What the hell is economic freedom, left versus right, left, on the left, they want the government to babysit the economy. On the right, they want the economy to be more free. They want the people in the economy to decide what they want and they want the market to decide what it wants to produce. <br>This sounds very abstract. I know. That's why we're going to jump back to the left. What do you mean by the left wants to babysit the economy? <br>Here's the thing, the left wants the government to have certain degrees of control in the economy. For example, poor people, poor people are very unfortunate, they're sad, they have no money, their parents have no money, And what can they do in this society? <br>They have no job, no house, they're just sad. So the government should help these people. The government should give them some money. The government takes the money from the rich people and gives it to the poor people. <br>The left tends to want the government to have more control in the economy and the left also wants to have a higher minimum wage. I know that you might not be too familiar with minimum wage. Minimum wage is basically the least amount of money somebody can earn from working per hour. <br>In Japan, the minimum wage per hour is about 700 yen, to 900 yen. So somebody must have at least earned this much per hour is not allowed, and the left wants to make the number bigger. <br>Why do they want to make the number bigger? Obviously, this is to help the workers, right, the higher the money the workers power and power, the better. In order for that to happen. The left wants to have higher taxes. What are taxes? Well taxes is the money that the government collects from people. <br>We pay taxes. Have you seen the VAT? I'm sure you have seen that, that's about 12%. So every time we buy something, we basically pay 12% of fucking taxes to the government, horrible, so that the government can do more things with the money. It can pay people more with the money. The left says that if you're rich, you should pay more taxes, because you already have so much money, so why not just pay taxes.<br> The left also wants free healthcare. Basically, the hospital should be free. The education should also be free to colleges, free, free, free, everything free, just the rich people pay all the taxes, pay all the taxes, pay 90% of all your money. <br>That's extreme far left, of course, not everybody is far left, I'm just talking about this extreme level so that you can understand what the moderate level is also like, okay I'm suddenly talking so fast, I'm sorry. <br><br>Anyways, what are the problems was the left? One problem was minimum wages that, for example, forced the business to pay more money to the workers. Okay, the business will be like, Okay, fine, I'm going to pay more money to my workers, but I'm going to secretly raise the price of my products so that I can steal more money. <br>Haha. Got outsmarted. So basically every time the employees have higher wages, the fucking products also increases their price, and thus inflation, oh no, that happens. <br><br>Another problem, for example, rich people. The left wants to tax the rich people a lot. The rich people, they don't want to be taxed. Why the hell should I give my money to you, I mean you didn't do anything, so the rich people are like: You know what, rich people go to another country where they don't tax them as much. You have countries like Singapore, with very low corporate taxes and rich people runs to Singapore and you know, they don't pay that much taxes for the corporations and stuff. There's also an island called the British Virgin Islands. And so many rich people run to that island, or move there and come to the islands, so they don't have to pay taxes to the government.<br> The rich people are too smart. Okay. And also one more problem is that rich people use the money in a very smart way. They use the money to invest. <br>But the government doesn't use the money in a smart way, because the government has no incentive for using the money in a smart way. <br>So, When the government has the rich people's money, they're not gonna use it very wisely. And that's a huge problem, that's a huge fact that happens all around the world. Also, we take money away from rich people, there will be less jobs. <br>Why, because the rich people are the ones that are expanding their business, and what do they need to expand their business. They need more people and more people means there'll be more jobs for people, and also rich people spend their money, when they spend their money. There are people working to give them what they want. For example, rich people buy a rocket ship. And people are like, oh my god that rich people you know he's doing nothing he's, he's buying a ship like what the hell all of us have nothing.<br><br> But somebody has to build a ship. So by rich people using the money to buy the ship, there's hundreds of jobs created. <br>What do you think the government can do with the money? I honestly have no idea. Like America gives away billions of dollars to other countries, just randomly you know we're such a nice culture we're going to give away our money. And then they also spend trillions of dollars giving money to random people who think that they will stay home because it's still COVID or something. <br>Even though COVID is pretty much over. In America, Joe Biden is still giving money to people so that they can stay home and not work. This is why we should not give too much money to the government, because they don't know what they're doing with the money.<br> Okay, let's move to the right. The right wants the government to fuck off. Stop messing with the economy, and basically right is the opposite of left, right, so take what I said less left and reverse all of those. <br>That's pretty much the right leaning approach. The market should focus more on demand and supply, focus more on bananas and apples instead of government just eating everything they want less taxes, remember I was talking about free education & free Medicare for the left. <br>Why the hell does the right doesn't want them to be free, the right want them to have competition with each other, they want the best service, the best quality service to win, because in market, people will always choose the best product with the cheapest price so the schools will have to compete with each other and to arrive at the best price and the best quality. Instead of giving free stuff, because if the school is free. The school doesn't have to improve the quality, because people who will go to them anyways because they are still free right. The schools can just do whatever the hell they want because the government is the one paying the money. And then people won't be price sensitive. For example, if the school has said service people won't care that much, because it's free, but if it's not free. The schools have to do it properly. If not, people will be pissed off. <br><br>Alright, but there's a lot of problem, with the right ideology. First of all, very obvious, the monopoly monopoly. Oh my god. One company has the potential to take over everything. Okay, let's just say, Apple. Apple, Incorporated. One day, Apple became so powerful, because there's no government control that they simply became the biggest company ever. They eat all their competitors because they have money to do so. <br>The government canâ€™t do anything, because Apple has all the money they can just bribe the government, and do whatever the hell they want to do right now actually. Let's have an imaginary example, we have this new brilliant person. Her name is Sakura Kano, and she made this brilliant, beautiful idea, that is 10 100 1000 times better than the apple, the apple the iPhone and Apple actually the apple so powerful, Apple could simply just eat you. <br>They could simply buy your idea, they can buy it and you cant refuse because Apple is just too goddamn powerful, something like this happened 100 years ago. <br>His name is Rockefeller, and he is the first American billionaire and you want to guess how he achieved it? He's a monopolist! So he basically owned 90% of the oil in the whole of America. Can you think of 90% of the oil in the whole country? And he basically owns 2% of the whole nation's wealth is so rich that he's basically 2% of the whole country, but one person 2% of the whole country. How crazy is that he basically bought all the oil companies. He owns all the railroads, and he is just too powerful, his net worth today would be $400 billion. Both Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are together. How crazy is that? Okay, enough with this stupid monopolists stuff. We also have other stuff like income inequality in a country like the United States or other countries that also applies this principle, i.e. equality is very apparent. The rich people live in a mansion, why would normal people like us, would just rent rooms with our roommates? <br>Unfortunately, this is what it is, it's very difficult for the world to be equal. Do you want to know why? Well here's why. There is a law in the universe, called the Pareto distribution. <br>Let me repeat the Pareto distribution. Have you noticed that the most famous people only consist of a few 1000 people? While there are millions and billions of people in the world.<br> Have you also noticed that the most famous music artists are only a few, but there are in reality millions of people who make music. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, these are the three names that everybody knows, but there were millions of people who actually tried to make music. <br>Why I think nature is designed this way. A few people own all the stuff in any given system, name any system, there is always one person on the top that has more things than maybe the bottom 10 people combined. I actually don't know why this is the case, but in the end, in a world like the capitalistic world that we live in. There's always going to be a winner. <br>A bunch of winners. But the cool thing is that you can be a winner, too, if you try really hard. Obviously there's poor people that are stuck on zero or negative 100. Those people have a very hard time to reach the top. <br>That is a huge problem because there are so many poor people and so many people that are just unlucky. Theyâ€™re sick when they're young to parents who are poor, they have a bad education. What can we do about these people? It is so hard. It's so unfair for them. This is a big flaw of the right wing ideology, because they believe that people can just help themselves. I don't believe that. I think some people are just unlucky, they need help from other people. And unfortunately, there are too many people that need help, so we can see, there are millions of people starving in Africa. There are millions of people dying because there's no jobs. Millions of people are dying to COVID because they can't afford health care. Horrible. There's so many horrible things that you can see, squid game portrayed pretty nicely. <br>The people there are so in debt, they don't care about other people anymore they kill other people, for the sake of their own good. The lack of money really brings out the evil in most people, money is not the root of the problem, lack of money is the problem. <br>And when we ignore that there's a problem, like right now. Then the problem will only increase. Alright, that's it for this topic and let's move on to the next one.
