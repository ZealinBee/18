  This whole thing has coming to an end. There are still a lot of things that I want to talk about. But unfortunately, I don't want to talk about the things that I'm not absolutely confident in. Along doing this whole thing. I have realized certain bad habit I have while talking and I have grown a certain distaste with my speech habits. I also realize that I can't really talk for long period Of time without any responses. All of these took a long time for me because I usually get stuck in my own thought. When I know that nobody's really listening in real time. Anyways, if there's one thing that we could take away from all these talking is that extremism is very scary and it is always bad in the end like the Communist Regime of China and North Korea, the fascism Regime of Nazi Germany, and Italy and many many more. Since it seemed always seems to kill people. It will always end in Massacre against the people who don't believe in the idea. Actually, I'm going to tell you my journey. At first, I don't really understand anything about politics and I thought that it is quite stupid. I had always liked Donald Trump back in 2016 because he was a meme back then, but I didn't really understand much. I knew that my parents didn't really like both candidates, but they said that Donald Trump was not that bad. So I just went along with it. My knowledge was pretty much blank back then. I the only thing that I knew for sure, was that the Chinese government is horrible and it is killing the people, not my religion, but not believe it is calling my belief, a cult and it is arresting people in China. If they knew what I believe in, they would come to my house and kidnap me and sell my organs. That's how I knew back then. But in 2018, A YouTube video began my political Journey. The video was by Steven Crowder. Why there are only two genders. I watched the video and most of the things that he said, was basically common sense. I was shocked at how the Western view of politics has become, it is becoming so left-leaning. That I as an outsider did not even understand how crazy it was. I started getting into a rabbit hole of learning all these things and I realized that the current political ideologies is very dangerous. I thought I knew everything, I thought the right was the correct way and the correct side. So I stuck along with it. I genuinely thought that I understood most of the things and I hated all these left-leaning politicians like, Obama, Bernie Sanders, and any countries that were, particularly left-leaning. Later on, I started to see my prejudices. I see a lot of people like me who are having the same opinion as me who doesn't really know much. And I realized that I'm actually just one of them. I don't really understand much about politics at all. If you ask me, why I'm on my side, I can't really give you a comprehensive answer at all. So I decided to go on this journey of learning more and defending my side. At first I was kind of convinced also by the left-leaning ideology that communism could work and about socialism and how evil capitalism is. The only thing that really stuck with me was how bad Capitalism can be but also realize that communism is definitely not a solution to capitalism. So I was never really on the left side of the political spectrum, and I always stayed somewhere on the right. Right now, I indentify  myself as a right-wing libertarian so fast that there is a, there's a law or Effect called a stunning Kruger effect. It's a really dumb name. But basically it's Stumming Kruger Effect is the less, you know about something, The more confident You are about that thing. Back in the day, when you nothing about politics and I just had my own views. I thought that I understood everything and everybody who are against me are stupid. I only consume the news that believe in my side as well. I'm looking for like that. The more confident that usually seen in the Youtube comment, or the more confident is sound. Usually the less they know, because the more, you know, the more you will understand how much things that you don't know, a four year old could draw a helicopter pretty badly, but you could still see that is a helicopter. The four-year-old thinks that's the helicopter. But in reality, that's just a very vague representation of the helicopter. Most people are the four-year-old. They could draw the helicopter and make it look like a helicopter, but that's too far away from the real helicopter. And I know that's a very dumb example, but it is what it is for most people. Of course, there are some people that are extremely smart that are also confident but you wouldn't see those extremely smart and confident people because they wouldn't be really talking to us. If they're super smart, they will realize that talking to people would not really be a very nice engagement for them. They would never engage in online arguments, because that's completely pointless for the super smart people. Also for the people that are extremely one-sided like me before or like some other lefties, or some other righties, They don't really understand their own sides. They don't really understand their own flaws and they simply deny it and laugh at it. The only thing they see is the other size floor and the problem is all they do is roast at the other side and not Provide any meaningful solution. I think I'm still somewhere there. I really hope that when I see a problem, I can think about the solution first before criticizing it like it's some sort of a joke. They also don't have their thoughts of their own. They're basically a parrot for their own ideology. Back in the day, when I was somewhere in the far, right? I was basically also a parrot for that ideology. I just parroted what the people said, the parotid Ben Shapiro I parroted Steven Crowder and most people in the modern debates and modern discourses are just parroting of each side. The left is basically parroting their own points and the right is doing the thing. That's why I really find discourses pretty pointless because it is just two people that are just repeating their own points. They're not really thinking for themselves. They're participating in group thinking. Group thinking could be good on a lot of things. But groups thinking for politics is extremely dangerous, because when people develop in group thinking, they stopped really thinking to themselves critically, that's why stupid people in big groups are very scary. Sometimes as we can observe when we are in a big group, we tend to not think and when there is like chanting like I was like "Let's go" then your brain will also turn into that mode. This is evolution. Our brain was designed that way. So if we turn to group think we can make some really bad decisions that we would not make by ourselves. Sometimes your response of your friends and all of you and make you really dumb decisions, like going to get drunk and, you know, You would not make that decision alone. Unless you're super sad or something, that is group thinking. And the bigger the group is the more dangerous. It could be. When there's group think. There is tribalism, tribalism is basically when people indentify themselves as the group, they're part of those group, for example, back in the day. I would identify myself as a right-leaning person and all these lefty still call themselves, you know, like left leanin persons. And the problem is, when we are in your tribe, we don't see other people's perspective properly. We only see ours. And all we do is make fun of the other side without actually trying to have a meaningful conversation with them. We also tend to dehumanize the other side. Back in the day. This is how War happens. The war happens when they are too much group thinking and tribalization. If I was a war leader that time, I will tell my people, the people in The Other Side, those are not humans. We would kill them these people, they're wrong when we dehumanize other people. There are strategies that happened like killing other people because we don't see them as humans anymore. Since they're so wrong for us. We stopped really seeing them as human fleshes and we don't feel bad if we just kill them, the more this escalate the more, it will be that way when someone's opinion so different from you, the first reaction you want to have is to roast them and that's not how it should go. Because this will only lead down to a very sad path of two side, hating each other and these two sides, both being controlled by a few people. Because when there is groupthink ,controlling these people are very, very easy. The reason why the media's are trying to separate us trying to separate us to two groups or three groups, is that they want to control us easily where our attention is focused, on roasting other people, or thinking how bad other people are. Our attention is not focus anymore on all these rich people and all those people in power, stealing our money and stuff. They're basically changing our attention and making us fight ourselves while they're having all the benefit, and that is why we should be very careful about group thinking. Good thinking is down to start revolutions. And that's all good. But if it this is using the wrong way, like it is right now, like vaccine division, like you're either a human or you're not human because you're not taking the vaccine because, you know, if you don't take the vaccine and you cant go to the restaurant, this division will only make people more hate towards each other. Instead of more hate towards the government is very interesting how the government is using these tactics to make us fight over each other while they control the most groups. So now you may ask, how can you develop a critical thinking and how can you avoid being one of these people? And how can you learn to read the news with critical mind? There are few things that you could follow in order to be like this. The first thing is, when you're reading or getting your information, try to see who's writing that information is the person writing the information trustworthy in their past. Do they have a good history? Like is this news network known to be a bad news network? You should be careful already when you're reading those and also you have to check, is this news network beneficial to the topic that they're talkin about? If this is CNN talking about some rich people on protecting these rich people. Maybe you should think: maybe CNN's paid by these rich, people who knows, start putting up guards on these. We are listening to opinion from another person, try to identify, is this person trying to just convince you or is this person trying to give you facts or what are the motive of this person? For example, me, I'm telling you these things because I want you to know what my opinions are and what are some facts are, and how you can think for yourself. If the other party does not like you to think for yourself and they want to think for you, you should directly put up a guard because when they are not allowing you to think or talk. That is a big red flag because they can't take what you're going to say. And they don't want you to talk. You can also contrast news information between different news websites. Check If there are any inconsistencies and check how they get their data. If you're really interested, if we were talking about the data of covid death, for example, you can think, how do this country classify a death as a covid test. Not just any other death. That's a very specific example, but you can basically get the correct information, the factual information by checking multiple different sources and see if they're aligned. Usually, if the right and the left sources agree on one thing, that's either very wrong or very right. If the right and wrong are both different than probably one of them is correct. And one of them is wrong, and that is very difficult to examine unless you go to the independent sources, not the right or the left by the sources that are not funded by anybody. Those people don't really have any motivations to lie because they don't really gain that much from lying there, not supported financially by other people. Them lying, only makes them less reliable and making people trust him less. Those are only a few ways that you can become more of a critical thinker obviously trying to think and form your own opinion about what everybody has to say is also very important and I hope today you got a lot from what I've said and see you on the next one.
